Welcome, you want to make a Integer Websoscket Server in trusted(not password) mode ?
Let's prepare your PI then use the lobby integer face (and Integer Map for documentation)


First you need to install Raspberry Pi OS on a SD card with PI Imager:
https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

Configure it with raspberrypi.local as hostname and root for admin.
Give the wifi name and password you plan to use.
